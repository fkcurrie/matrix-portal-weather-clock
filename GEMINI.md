## Project Context

-   **Hardware:** Adafruit Matrix Portal M4 with a 64x64 LED screen.
-   **Connection:** USB
-   **Software:** PlatformIO with C++
-   **Primary Documentation:** https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-matrixportal-m4?view=all

## Goal

The project is a feature-rich, stable analog clock and weather display. It has been optimized for long-term performance and includes a polished, animated boot sequence.

## History

The project initially attempted to use CircuitPython but was successfully pivoted to a PlatformIO-based C++ toolchain. All initial stability and performance issues have been resolved. The current C++ implementation is robust and feature-complete.
