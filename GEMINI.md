## Project Context

-   **Hardware:** Adafruit Matrix Portal M4 with a 64x64 LED screen.
-   **Connection:** USB
-   **Software:** PlatformIO with C++
-   **Primary Documentation:** https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-matrixportal-m4?view=all

## Goal

The main goal is to get the Matrix Portal M4 to display something cool on the LED screen. The project will start with a basic C++ "Hello World" example and then evolve to more complex visuals.

## History

The project initially attempted to use CircuitPython but encountered persistent, unresolvable errors. The decision was made to pivot to a PlatformIO-based C++ toolchain for better performance and lower-level hardware control.
